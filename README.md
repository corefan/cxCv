cxCv
====

A wrapper around OpenCV with the same ideas as ofxCv and the OpenCV library for Processing, that is to make using OpenCV as easy 
as possible while retaining the ability to use the API like you normally would. 

This is built for Cinder and built on and around some of the existing libraries and code out there like

1. (ofxCv)[https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv]
2. (OpenCV for Processing)[https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing]
3. Cinder's current openCV capabilities
